# GestureRecognition

## Problem Statement
  As a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions, I wanted to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.

Below are the gestures, and associated commands for the same.

  - Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
  - Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
  - Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
  - Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds
  - Stop: Pause the movie

## Objective of the Assignment:
- Train different models (of Conv3D, and CNN+RNN), on the 'train' folder which performs well on the validation data ( 'val') folder as well.
